<h2 id="abondstrongerthangunsandcanons">A Bond Stronger Than Guns And Canons</h2>

<p>At ease Comrades.<br />
The day of rest has arrived.<br />
For we are chosen to inherit<br />
the fruits of our ancestors past.<br />
Will you join in our last stand,<br />
And make our freedoms last?<br />
May our reign last for one thousand,<br />
eight thousand years.<br />
Until the last speck of dust,<br />
withers into the sands of time.<br />
<br />
Refrain<br />
We are the bakers with baguettes,<br />
and the farmers who grow cherry trees.<br />
From the fields of glory to the distant pastures.<br />
Let our freedoms last for many generations.<br />
<br />
We were once slaves to distant lands from East to West,<br />
With languages not our own.<br />
Yet here we our survivors after the fall of Rome,<br />
We don't need kings or masters,<br />
because we our the masters of our own dominion.<br />
<br />
Refrain<br />
We are the bakers with baguettes,<br />
and the farmers who grow cherry trees.<br />
From the fields of glory to the distant pastures.<br />
Let our freedoms last for many generations.<br />
<br />
Those in other land may have guns and canons,<br />
yet we have something much stronger that is a lasting bond,<br />
Based on common values that blends<br />
our parents from distant lands.<br />
<br />
Though we our from Europe and from Asia,<br />
We need be limited to this, for we are "Cool Japan",<br />
Not Cruel France, with their imperial enablers in the East.<br />
</p>


<h2 id="alandofdeerandravens">A Land Of Deer And Ravens</h2>

<p>In the forest with<br />
the flowing river, the deer<br />
sips from running tap.<br />
The gentle breeze has<br />
one eventually<br />
nap, till rain falls.<br />
<br />
As the gust gusting<br />
blows away the village,<br />
Raven rests, plotting<br />
demise of the rodents<br />
who rest on the tombstones.<br />
<br />
Hark all the rodents that rest<br />
and endure the birds feast.<br />
<br />
And like that the<br />
world continues on its<br />
downward path, fire<br />
burns the land in splendor,<br />
as world burning to dust.<br />
<br />
Yet there will be<br />
always those rodents that<br />
endure all woes.<br />
As world burning to dust,<br />
a doorway now opens.<br />
<br />
And beyond is a<br />
portal where there is<br />
no hunger ever.</p>

<h2 id="AnosSunamosKuros">Anos Sunamos Kuros</h2>

<p>
Anos sunamos kuros, the waves was as the night.<br />
Anos sunamos kuros, the water was cold as night.<br />
Anos sunamos kuros, my blanket of longful chill.<br />
Only in dreams do the waves subside and warm.<br />
And by the sea do girls and their pet cats sleep.<br />
<br />
Anos sunamos kuros, avec lana esuna.<br />
By the moon I seek the warming winds of time.<br />
La fille avec elles chaveaux avoir lanos nekos.<br />
<br />
Anos sunamos kuros, the waves was as the night.<br />
Anos sunamos kuros, the water was cold as night.<br />
Anos sunamos kuros, my blanket of longful chill.<br />
Only in dreams do the waves subside and warm.<br />
And by the sea do girls and their pet cats sleep.<br />
<br />
Au revoir anos sunamos chaud,<br />
Perhaps the waves will meet again.
</p>


<h2 id="beviledtines">Beviled Tines</h2>

<p>Izu mihi zumi,<br />
Izu mihi zumi<br />
izu mihi zu.<br />
Izu mihi zumi,<br />
Izu mihi zumi.<br />
<br />
In my dreams I think<br />
of nightmares, razors<br />
along the spine.<br />
In my dreams I think:<br />
blood like wine.<br />
In my dreams I remember all the pain.<br />
From razor blades with the beveled tines.<br />
<br />
Blood flows like the<br />
spout from a lave,<br />
spewing out as<br />
if it were merely<br />
lava in a mountain.<br />
In my dreams I remember all the pain.<br />
From razor blades with the beveled tines.</p>


<h2 id="chrysanthemumchant">Chrysanthemum Chant</h2>

<p>
Chains on fence give suspense.<br />
The guillotines are bloody as the dead do pile.<br />
Come and stay with me today.<br />
<br />
Chains on fence give suspense,<br />
in courtyard by the fence the dead rot long<br />
all in a pile. All in a pile<br />
<br />
Come and stay with me today,<br />
all the roses and petunias don't compare,<br />
to Chrysthamums common and scarce.
</p>


<h2 id="faitavecamour">Fait Avec Amour</h2>

<p>
Fait avec amour, the girl dressed as a maid.<br />
Fait avec amour, with a single braid.<br />
Fait avec amour, with a bow in hair.<br />
Elle chaveaux es anos kuros.<br />
<br />
Fait avec amour, the midnight is young.<br />
Fait avec amour, the moon hangs over clear skies.<br />
Fait avec amour, je lieb han elles anos kuros chaveux.<br />
Elle chaveaux es anos kuros.<br />
<br />
Her hair soft and<br />
fluffy, flows in the wind gust.<br />
The train passes.<br />
<br />
Fait avec amour, la rosette es petite.<br />
Mais avec anu raifuru elle tire le sheriff.
</p>


<h2 id="kozupappara">Kozupappara</h2>
<p>Izu mihi zu.<br />
<br />
The cherry trees<br />
wither away to<br />
gusting.<br />
And mountains flurry<br />
in the Winter Sun<br />
shining.<br />
For you my rose your<br />
glow lasts all seasons<br />
living.<br />
<br />
It had been years / sense your heading<br />
when the widow blade fell / in the city of barb wire<br />
fence, town like / the Kozukappara.<br />
<br />
Useful propaganda<br />
does not hide the<br />
attrocities of man.<br />
<br />
The cherry trees<br />
wither away to<br />
gusting.<br />
And mountains flurry<br />
in the Winter Sun<br />
shining.<br />
For you my rose your<br />
glow lasts all seasons<br />
living.<br />
<br />
And in this city like Kozukappara,<br />
the cicadas come home to roost.
</p>


<h2 id="laalsacededecimation">La Alsace De Decimation</h2>

<p>
I<br />
<br />
Beneath the fields<br />
In green, the Germans burn<br />
Zillions, Alsace flowers<br />
Must wither into all the ash.<br />
<br />
Alsace, rose<br />
Red with evergreen.<br />
Churn and decimate.<br />
<br />
Avenge the Alsace,<br />
Mes vie de Paris.<br />
Iglorious Allemain de mort.<br />
<br />
II<br />
<br />
Germans scortch the<br />
French by route of Roses<br />
in the Alsace.<br />
<br />
In a ring of fire<br />
the Germans shot the arrows.<br />
And now Alsace<br />
<br />
sits and waits, for<br />
the flames to burn close.<br />
<br />
Come France, rescue Alsace<br />
from Decimation.
</p>


<h2 id="lanospaindechocolatekurokanaru">Lanos Pain De Chocolate Kurokanaru</h2>

<p>Pain de chocolate<br />
fait avec amour.<br />
Le chocolate<br />
d'engel femme fait.<br />
<br />
D'engel femme avec<br />
pain de chocolate.<br />
<br />
Le chocolate es anos kurokanaru,<br />
et c"est chaud.<br />
Je veux le pain de chocolate.<br />
Fait avec amour.<br />
<br />
Mes mere fait avec amour,<br />
Fait avec amour.<br />
Je veux le chocolate.
</p>


<h2 id="lotusinthepiano">Lotus In The Piano</h2>
<p>
Like pianos / sitting by window,<br />
life is a mix of highs / and lows near the flower<br />
garden, Lotuses / and daisies.<br />
<br />
Under moonlight / in Winter Forest<br />
the flowers wilt as Summer / fades to memories.<br />
<br />
In world without / a sun to light the<br />
forest, the Winter / chill is the only<br />
melody for which may / seek solace with death.<br />
<br />
And soon, midnight / comes to reap, for<br />
we are only dust.
</p>


<h2 id="majapon">Ma Japon</h2>

<p>From Mount Azo<br />
to Tokyo streets<br />
flowing,<br />
I always will sleep<br />
winters, with cherry<br />
trees.<br />
And this raw fish you<br />
call Sushi, with BBQ<br />
sauce.<br />
Ma Japon<br />
<br />
Although I am<br />
without deception<br />
for books<br />
of girls with large<br />
eyes, and twirling<br />
wands, I cant help but drift<br />
away to new things<br />
to read.<br />
Ma Japon.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it is I<br />
cant relate to<br />
to the<br />
embrace of old<br />
waifus, with their sweet<br />
looks<br />
reading other books<br />
from city of "le vin et<br />
du pain".<br />
Ma Japon<br />
<br />
But it is that look<br />
that some adore<br />
that for<br />
me makes me drift off<br />
away to other lands<br />
of gold.<br />
Youll here about<br />
working conditions,<br />
manga<br />
creators with their desks<br />
underpayed and<br />
hungry.<br />
Ma Japon.<br />
<br />
And yet Winter has<br />
arrived once more<br />
for me, Ma Japon.<br />
With mount Azo growing<br />
distant, as I now go on.<br />
Ma Japon.<br />
</p>


<h2 id="MariyaMesSoleil">Mariya Mes Soleil</h2>

<p>Mozhi mozhi Mariya,<br />
Enchante au vous.<br />
Enchante au tu<br />
mes rosette avec un<br />
rose pour mes jardin.<br />
<br />
Je veux cette chaveux noir,<br />
avec cette rose en chaveux.<br />
<br />
Le sabots de arbres et le cheveux<br />
de Mariya es mes Soleil.<br />
Mes Mariya de rose.
</p>


<h2 id="mesamidemort">Mes Ami De Mort</h2>

<p>
Midnight forest chills<br />
the bone, in flowing dress<br />
of white. Au Revoir.<br />
Au revoir humanitie,<br />
Sayonara, je suis mort.<br />
<br />
Os Anos Behansos, my wife to be.<br />
Os Anos Behansos, my true love to be.<br />
Os Anos Behansos, elle in a white dress.<br />
<br />
To think we lived<br />
together in embrace,<br />
one may never<br />
<br />
Guess.<br />
<br />
Os Anos Behansos, my wife to be.<br />
Os Anos Behansos, my true love to be.<br />
Os Anos Behansos, elle in a white dress.<br />
<br />
Vous es mes femme.<br />
Mes ami de mort.
</p>


<h2 id="obliquerose">Oblique Rose</h2>
<p>The razor blade<br />
is sharp as can be, as it<br />
slices my neck.<br />
To think that life is such<br />
pain in the blouse.<br />
<br />
Indeed fair<br />
Mme, for death very kind<br />
as it's cut throat.<br />
I savor the blood and<br />
tears from neck to cheeks.<br />
  Oblique.<br />
<br />
It cuts through petite neck.<br />
  Oblique<br />
<br />
is the blade that slices swift,<br />
gently yet with much vigor.<br />
Your face is my Rose.<br />
Oblique.<br />
<br />
We are dust,<br />
the midnight is drawing near.<br />
We are dust,<br />
as the gears are rusting.<br />
The gears so rusting cranking<br />
until we are no more.<br />
We are dust.<br />
<br />
And with our blouse,<br />
for now we must perish.
</p>


<h2 id="ourrobomance">Our Robomance</h2>
<p>Robonekurofira, my love is true.<br />
Rononekurofira, my robot my bride.<br />
Rononekurofira, my bride for life.<br />
And who but my girl of rust and sunset.<br />
<br />
You never broke your vows,<br />
Despite falling to pieces.<br />
My lifeless puppet of clockwork<br />
As we rest beyond the crypt.<br />
<br />
Indeed, my human of the Earth<br />
With life and the world to see,<br />
I see not why you remember me,<br />
despite being of iron and rust.<br />
<br />
We barely knew each other,<br />
And yet I knew it was meant to be,<br />
From your charging cable<br />
And the connection between us.<br />
<br />
Other people had wanted me,<br />
And yet despite my simulation,<br />
And you being of flesh,<br />
For you I only felt free.<br />
<br />
When the scanners came,<br />
took my heart away<br />
I could only think our embrace,<br />
with cracks in my face.<br />
<br />
It is merely a blemish,<br />
For we are now one, as we dip<br />
further into the simulation,<br />
And take a trip.<br />
<br />
Robonekurofira, out love is true.<br />
Rononekurofira, our robot bodies.<br />
Rononekurofira, our souls as one.<br />
And who but us of rust and sunset.
</p>


<h2 id="scrapyardofbots">Scrapyard Of Bots: Os Laimenkos</h2>
<p>Corpses without the stink<br />
go out in wink.<br />
Sunrise overhead<br />
rises up and blinks.<br />
The razors and screws rusting<br />
<br />
Give way to lust<br />
and despair<br />
longing.<br />
One longs for the night<br />
under the starlight<br />
resting<br />
under the scrapyard<br />
where one is<br />
drifting.<br />
<br />
Corpses without the stink<br />
go out in wink.<br />
Sunrise overhead<br />
rises up and blinks.<br />
The razors and screws rusting<br />
<br />
All in a pile<br />
waiting for a doctor<br />
to fix the parts.<br />
</p>


<h2 id="sifiyapehuma">SIFIYAPEHUMA - LADY OF THE RAIN</h2>
<p>Lady of the rain<br />
    Namaksin<br />
in the dirt, carries large<br />
    umbra.<br />
<br />
She is walking in the rain,<br />
through storm and the sun<br />
trotting long.<br />
The pathless<br />
<br />
Voyage<br />
    she walks and rests long.<br />
In the dirt, carries large<br />
    umbra.<br />
<br />
Rain stops.<br />
<br />
With rosed braid<br />
    skirt ripplesin the wind.<br />
In her clogs she aches with all her pain<br />
    wincing.<br />
<br />
Rain starts,<br />
and finally stops.<br />
<br />
If one could<br />
    offer a<br />
home for the needy,<br />
    may the<br />
<br />
drops stop.<br />
And never return.

<h1 id="volumetwo">VOLUME TWO</h1>

<h2 id="haremsandrobots">Harems Of Robots</h2>
<p>With Japan you think<br />
of Harems in manga and robots.<br />
With Japan you think<br />
of Sumi paintings and Haiku<br />
with Geisha and Samurai swords.<br />
All that and bushido code.<br />
With Japan you think<br />
<br />
Of many things but<br />
what it is when you ride<br />
the bullet train.<br />
<br />
No Harem books.<br />
This is not that fairytale.<br />
No Harem books<br />
but a life of Dr. Faust with<br />
his offer to all the devil<br />
that write life's storybook.<br />
No Harem books.<br />
<br />
Instead this my stort of<br />
a girl with one large bow.
</p>


<h2 id="notparisortokyo">Not Paris Or Tokyo</h2>
<p>My Alsace.<br />
It's not Paris or old Tokyo.<br />
My Alsace,<br />
with flower gardens and rivers<br />
as roads in Summer Strasbourg.<br />
Like a taste of Beer.<br />
My Alsace.<br />
<br />
With Alsace the<br />
expectations do not<br />
diverge. It glues.<br />
<br />
In Manga journals<br />
they say the gates, and yet<br />
In Manga journals<br />
it is work culture remains.<br />
If contests were all Japan,<br />
then what does this say of Tokyo.<br />
In Manga journals<br />
<br />
Where gates shut<br />
out, the talented and the<br />
oppressed. Alsace<br />
<br />
For me, at least<br />
is what keeps me possessed<br />
with its open gates.<br />
With Manwha coming close,<br />
tempting me with French country.<br />
<br />
And KPop at the door.
</p>


<h2 id="onlyeyesformemyzombiequeen">Only Eyes For Me, My Zombie Queen</h2>
<p>I am floating.<br />
The water soaks the flowers.<br />
I am floating<br />
in a boat under the rain.<br />
In the rain I sleep with<br />
the fishes under moonlight.<br />
I am floating.<br />
<br />
The moonlight that<br />
shines its graces on<br />
you, my queen.<br />
<br />
In distant past<br />
when this land was for only us,<br />
in distant past<br />
men took you away from me.<br />
And left you to rot with all the<br />
fishes under the moonlight.<br />
In distant past.<br />
<br />
Yet no missiles can<br />
take you away from me.<br />
My daisy queen.<br />
<br />
Because we are not merely of the flesh.<br />
There is more to us than meets the eyes my queen,<br />
the zombie queen whom only has eye for me.

<h2 id="ourlivesneverfarapart">Our Lives Never Far Apart</h2>
<p>My girl of rose / with curly black hair,<br />
You are my fair queen / and with me always there.<br />
The moonlight is young / your songbirds hum sung.<br />
<br />
Between me / and the starlight<br />
there is the world to see / with fields of green and yellow.<br />
Between me / and the starlight<br />
there is nothing I cant for you / even if it destroys our life.<br />
The fields of glory a fragile / as the missles come falling.<br />
There is nothing I cant for you / even if it destroys our life.<br />
<br />
My girl of rose / with curly black hair,<br />
You are my fair queen / and with me always there.<br />
The moonlight is young / your songbirds hum sung.<br />
<br />
With your hair / like ebony.<br />
Our lives are never far apart.

<h2 id="tombstonewiththecrows">Tombstone With The Crows</h2>
<p>I sit and think<br />
of all the times we had bled.<br />
I sit and think<br />
of the chilly mornings sleep<br />
by the tombstone with the crows<br />
that comfort me here with you.<br />
I sit and think.<br />
<br />
Silence chilly,<br />
I long for your embrace.<br />
Those fading breaths.<br />
<br />
You hold my head.<br />
And I hold yours with me.v
You hold my head<br />
and we become statues<br />
under the moonlight, chilly<br />
midnight dreaming waiting.<br />
You hold my head.<br />
<br />
But yours falls your neck<br />
and tumbles down staircase,<br />
greets me staring at<br />
the moonlight in our wake.<br />

<p>In the midnight forest<br />

In midnight castle<br />
